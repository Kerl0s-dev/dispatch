## 🕵️‍♂️ About the Game

**Dispatch** is an immersive **first-person psychological experience** that drops you into the eerie atmosphere of an **old, recovered VHS tape**.  
There are **no weapons, no enemies, and no HUD** — just you, your surroundings, and the heavy silence of a place that wants to be forgotten.

Explore abandoned locations, uncover fragments of a story, and piece together the truth behind the mission you were sent on.  
Every flicker of light, every corridor, and every detail tells a story — if you dare to look closely.
